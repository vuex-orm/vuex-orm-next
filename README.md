## Status: Draft

This repo is for the next iteration of Vuex ORM. It’s in an active development state and we are hoping it is going to be the foundation of the version 1.0.0 release. Any and all feedback is welcome!

The current implementation requires native ES2015+ in the runtime environment and does not support IE11 (yet).

In addition, new documentation is ongoing and can be found at https://next.vuex-orm.org.
