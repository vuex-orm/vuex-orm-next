## Important !

Be sure to disable `useDefineForClassFields` when using `vite@2.5.0+` else `vuex-orm` won't work anymore ! [#4636](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/4636)

`tsconfig.json`
```json
...
"useDefineForClassFields": false,

```

## Status: Draft

This repo is for the next iteration of Vuex ORM. Itâ€™s in an active development state and we are hoping it is going to be the foundation of the version 1.0.0 release. Any and all feedback is welcome!

In addition, new documentation is ongoing and can be found at https://next.vuex-orm.org.
